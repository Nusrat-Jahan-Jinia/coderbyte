/* 
You have a passage of text that needs to be retyped. Unfortunately, some of the letter keys on your keyboard are broken!
Given an array letters representing the working letter keys and a string text, your task is to determine how many words 
from text can be typed in full using the broken keyboard.
It is guaranteed that all non-letter keys (including digits, punctuation marks, and special characters) are working.
